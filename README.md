## Overview of the Project

### Project: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
![image](https://github.com/cybernistul/CODTECH-TASK1/assets/169300257/f928a882-f542-4cfe-9638-18636664b79b)


### Objective
The Objective of the project is to develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

### Key Activities
- **Assess strength of your password with color coded meter**:

ðŸ”´ Weak = Red color
ðŸŸ¤ Moderate = Brown color
ðŸŸ£ Strong = Purple color
ðŸŸ¢ Very strong = Green color
- Displays reasons when password is not strong enough instantly
- Displays ideas to improve password strength
- Toggle your password visibility when typing and checking
- Alerts user to change the password when the password has commonly used passwords worldwide as it is easy to hack
- Alerts user when essential parts of a strong password such as mix of letters, number,symbol is not used.
- Warns users if their password contains repeated characters in sequence.
- Works offline without Internet connection


### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Tkinter**: A built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- **PicturesBase64**: A module presumably containing base64 encoded images used in the application

### Key Insights
Population Distributions: Histograms to show how populations have been distributed over time.
Inter-year Relationships: Scatter plots to reveal relationships between population data from different years.
Correlation Patterns: Heatmaps to display the correlation between populations over the years, highlighting significant trends and patterns.


This project provides a comprehensive overview of global population trends and insights, useful for further studies or policy-making related to demographic changes.
